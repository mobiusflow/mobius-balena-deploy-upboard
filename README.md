## About

MobiusFlow® is a scalable, device and protocol agnostic IoT system that can enable an increase
in global efficiencies, reduce environmental impact and waste, whilst connecting millions of devices
via numerous ecosystems, across multiple locations, to be analysed and acted upon remotely based on
actual real-time data.

A huge range of sensors can be connected to MobiusFlow® to transmit the relevant data to multiple
sources for analysis and actions based on agreed parameters for each device, environment or combined
with third party data such as local weather stations to adjust systems accordingly.
