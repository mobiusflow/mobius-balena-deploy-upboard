  ## About

  MobiusFlow® is a scalable, device and protocol agnostic IoT system that can enable an increase 
  in global efficiencies, reduce environmental impact and waste, whilst connecting millions of devices 
  via numerous ecosystems, across multiple locations, to be analysed and acted upon remotely based on 
  actual real-time data.

  A huge range of sensors can be connected to MobiusFlow® to transmit the relevant data to multiple 
  sources for analysis and actions based on agreed parameters for each device, environment or combined 
  with third party data such as local weather stations to adjust systems accordingly.
